  <h1>Pawnee Rangers Project Proposal</h1>
<hr>
<h3>Overview:</h3>
	<p>The main purpose of this project is to provide a tethys application that can be used for least cost path analysis. Unlike previous 414 projects that used least cost path for specific tasks, our web application will provide enough functionality to analyze least cost paths for a variety of purposes. Whether a user wants to find the safest route for a bike race, best location for a pipeline, fastest route to a certain location, or any other path related purpose, our application will be able to provide a solution.
	In order to accomplish this purpose, our application will also have a variety of layers that can be toggled on and off and analyzed with arcgis tools such as buffer, intersect, clip, etc. The user will be able to select which layers they want to use for their analysis as well as the starting and end locations for their paths.
</p> <hr>
<h3>Responsibilities:</h3>
<p>For this project, there are three main areas of focus. Each of us will lead an area of focus for this project. The first area is gathering and storing the data that the application can use. It is important to know how each dataset is structured so that the results from the geoprocessing workflow are viable. Jordi will lead out the data aspect of this project.
The second area is the back-end of the application. This includes how the app will analyze the data and produce the desired results. The back-end will focus on how the application communicates with the user and the server. Corey will be leading out the back-end aspect for this application. 
The last area of focus in the front-end of the application. This area will focus on the visualization and how the results of the analysis will be displayed for the user. It will also focus on providing a simple, yet extensive, interface so that the user can select what parameters will be used for the analysis. Ken will be the lead for the front-end aspect of the project. 
</p> <hr>
<h3>Data :</h3>
<p>Various types of vector and raster data analyses will be needed in order to allow the kind of flexibility and user-customizability that is desired for this project. Tools such as buffer, multi-ring buffer, clip, mosaic to new raster, intersect, raster calculator, and cost path are all expected to be used extensively. As the project progresses, it will become more readily apparent what types of data and data tools will be utilized in the application.
It is anticipated that a wide variety of data should be distributed to the app from map services, etc. The more data that is available to the app, the more diverse the applications for least-cost path scenarios. These data are likely to include (depending upon availability) city and county boundary data, roadway networks, landuse and parcel ownership, utility data, canals, rivers and streams, traffic count data, transit route data, elevation DEM data, water-table data, city zoning data, etc. All of these data-sets will serve to make the application completely configurable for any type of engineering least-cost path analysis that would be needed in the state of Utah.

<h3>Back-End:</h3>
<p>The workflows will be very similar to much of the 414 projects that used least cost path. The main tool that will be used is cost path but buffers, intersects, and other tools will be used as well. The user will be allowed to select which layers they would like to use and then define how much to buffer and weight each layer they have selected. The user will also select their starting and ending locations. When the parameters are set, we will send the user information to the server and the server will follow a similar pattern to the modelbuilders of the 414 projects that did least cost path. It will buffer the layers, convert them to raster, reclassify the values, calculate values, find cost distance, and then determine the least cost path. The results will be sent back to the app and displayed on the map.
Based on the size of the data and the layers selected, the processing time may be an issue. We will limit our scope to Utah but if processing time is too much, we may have to limit it to a county or two in Utah. We may have to limit the amount of layers that can be selected or the user will be waiting for a very long time and not want to use it. 
This code will be stored on Corey Krewsonâ€™s GitHub account (krewgar). We will also provide a readme file on github which will describe how the app is set up and how to install it.

<h3>Front-End:</h3>
<p>We want the front end user interface to be simple and intuitive while still offering a wide range of options for the user. The purpose of this app is not to replace the least cost path functionality of ArcMap, but to offer a quick, streamlined option for users. The layout will be similar to ArcMap with a large map being the main view and a sidebar with a list of active layers. Clicking on these layers should allow the user to define their buffers and weights with sliders. Additionally, the user interface will include options for creating a start and end point, and a button for recalculating the least cost path. There will also be an input for users to define what they are creating. We will include some basic options such as roads, pipelines, and power lines, but the user should be able to create their own. Due to the large amount of user input, we will use modals for much of this input.
We might be able to use AJAX to update the path in real time as the user edits options, but this will depend on how long the calculation takes. Additionally, we may include options to allow the user to use lines and polygons in addition to points for their start and end features. Although some data will be included with the app, we would like to allow users to upload their own data if they want. As we develop the app we will some of these additional features, but our goal is to ultimately provide a pleasant user experience, not the full functionality of ArcMap.

<h3>License:</h3>
	<p>We want our app to be open-source, so we will be using the General Public License for our app. This license allows us to distribute and modify the application in any way we see fit, and anyone who receives the software will have the same rights. Basically, this license provides basic protections for both the authors and the users of the software.
