<hr>
<p>My name is Jordi, and I am a Master's Degree student at BYU. I speak fluent spanish and hick english, with a touch of
  Sean Connery on occasion. I enjoy good food, good people, and good talk.I love the outdoors, puppies, and all
  forms of Doggo Memes. I love to swim and exercise. I also love the 2nd amendment and target shooting/plinking out in
  the West desert. Shown above is a picture of me on a BYU study abroad in Shanghai. One day I want to travel the world
  with my future family. I'm all about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Oh, and I'm a civil engineer.</p>
